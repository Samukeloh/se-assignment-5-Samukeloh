Initialize Repository:

If your project folder is not yet a Git repository, you’ll see a message prompting you to Initialize Repository. Click this button to create a new Git repository in your project folder.

Alternatively, you can initialize a repository using the Command Palette:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
Type Git: Initialize Repository and select it.
Check Repository Status:

After initialization, VS Code will recognize the folder as a Git repository. The Source Control view will show a list of files and changes.
2. Making Commits
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of changed files. To stage changes (prepare them for committing), click the + icon next to each file or use the Stage All Changes button (the icon with the + symbol next to Changes).
Enter Commit Message:

In the Message input box at the top of the Source Control view, type a descriptive commit message.
Commit Changes:

Click the ✔ (checkmark) icon or press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on macOS) to commit the staged changes. Your commit will now be added to the local Git history.
3. Pushing Changes to GitHub
Create a Repository on GitHub
Log in to GitHub:

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Create a New Repository:

Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Enter a repository name, choose its visibility (public or private), and click Create repository.
Add Remote Repository in VS Code
Copy Repository URL:

After creating the repository on GitHub, you’ll be redirected to the repository page. Copy the URL from the Code button (use the HTTPS or SSH URL).
Add Remote URL:

Open the Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+ orCmd+ on macOS) and add the remote URL by running:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL you copied from GitHub.
Push Changes:

To push your local commits to GitHub, use the Terminal or the Source Control view:
Using Terminal:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
or, if you’re using the main branch:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Using Source Control View:
Click on the ... (more actions) menu in the Source Control view.
Select Push or Push to to push your changes to the remote repository.
